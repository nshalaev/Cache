# Cache

This repository contains implementation of two caches:
<ul>
<li>LFU - least frequently used</li>
<li>LRU - least recently used</li>
</ul>

Caches are created by CacheFactory with two parameters:
<ul>
<li>Capacity</li>
<li>Eviction strategy type</li>
</ul>
LRU is default eviction type of cache.
